			<p id = "summary">I am Tony Oliverio, a rising third year student studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at U.C. Berkeley. In the past, I've done a lot of software development in embedded systems applications, but I am currently looking for opportunities to show my skills in more pure user-facing software application development. My previous work experiences have given me a unique insider perspective on the technologies that power IoT as an industry and I hope to apply this knowledge to developing applications for users. As a developer, I love making an impact and seeing my impact come to fruition, especially when it affects end users.
