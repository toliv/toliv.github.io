			<p id = "summary">My name is Tony Oliverio and I am a sophmore attending UC Berkeley pursuing a degree in  Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Previously as an intern, I've worked in Texas Instruments' Bluetooth Low Energy Software team, Texas Instruments' RTOS team, and at a control systems lab at UC Santa Barbara. These past experiences have given me the unique background of firsthand experience with some of the newest and hottest technological innovations in embedded systems on a fundamental level.
